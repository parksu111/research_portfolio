![fig1](https://github.com/parksu111/research_portfolio/blob/main/img/fig1.png)
Modelling the ultradian regulation of REM sleep in mice and using the model to investigate electrophysiologial features of the mouse brain during various stages of sleep. Paper has been published in **PLOS Computational Biology** and can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009316).

## Other Data Science Projects

* [Automatic classification of sleep states](https://github.com/parksu111/mouse_sleep_auto_classification/blob/main/overview.ipynb): Using deep neural networks with EEG and EMG data obtained from mice to classify sleep states. This is an ongoing project and will continue to be updated.
  * [Overview](https://github.com/parksu111/mouse_sleep_auto_classification/blob/main/overview.ipynb)
  * [Image Classification](https://github.com/parksu111/mouse_sleep_auto_classification/blob/main/img_classification.ipynb): Sleep-scoring as an image classification task.
  * Digital Signal Classification: Sleep-scoring as a signal classification task. To be updated
  * [Pipeline](https://github.com/parksu111/skynet): Automatic classification pipeline made for use at the Chung Lab and Weber Lab at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.

* [Movie Series Analysis](https://rpubs.com/parksu111/796294): Analyzing the commercial success of movie franchises and predicting the success of the next movie in a series using a variety of methods including: LASSO (multinomial) logistic regression, CART, random forest. This was work done as a final project for the course *STAT571: Modern Data Mining* (Fall 2019) at the University of Pennsylvania.
